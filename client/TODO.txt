Creating character:
[] Simple POC without ThreeJs
    - [] a few areas to fill textures when selecting stuff
    - [] how can I associate character parts with the selection?
            - Maybe I should add a new field in the object, beside texturePath, I should have the name of the closest parent folder
                which will corelate with the element of the character.
                for example 
                {
                    "characterPart" : "head"
                    "characterPart" : "mouth"
                }
            - each characterPart should also be in the character build
    - [] how can I share the selected parts with the Print?
[] Understand how can I use https://threejs.org/
